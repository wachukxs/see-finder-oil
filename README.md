# A little about Finder OIL Landing page

Given the time factor, and the limited information I had about the company, I thought it best to come up with a single page website.

The site is divided into several sections, with each section containing enough information for any site visitor.
I was careful not to use too much words and paragraph which would have been distracting, but just enough to inform anyone reading.

The content and info of each section naturally leads on to the next section.

I have also created a dummy logo, with icons supporting every accessible platforms (broswer, iPhones, Android and Windows phone). This helps to increase brand recognition and SEO. The site is also a progrssive web app, which means site visitors can pin the site to their home screen like a native app.

Fast page loading.
